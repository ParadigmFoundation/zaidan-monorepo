## Package `zeroex`

This `zeroex` package is a slimmed-down version of [`0x-mesh/zeroex`](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-mesh/blob/0xV3/zeroex) with only the functionality needed for our purposes. It consists largely of code copied directly from that branch.

This is necessary because 0x has not yet published the version of `zeroex` that supports 0x V3.
